               <h2><u>Why you choose Us ?</u></h2>
               <p>The emphasis of existing education system, including the training towards JEE (IIT), is highly skewed towards the Quantitative aspect and not much on the Qualitative aspect of Science. Hence, the teaching is based only on the Mathematical Formulation. This system for sure, has created numerous IITians and others with excellent problem solving skills and sound analytical abilities, but unfortunately not many with the capability to Invent/Innovate.</p>

                    <h3>Elevation of Computer Science as a Core Subject</h3>
                    <p>Computer Science has been elevated to the level of a core subject with Programming introduced from Primary Level. The Students will learn the implementation of Algorithms through C / C++ from Std VI onwards.</p>
